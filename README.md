## Running the Project
### Login
A default user has been added for presentation purposes. Username:sales Password:doxim

### Build Page
The build page controls the entire web application. Once you select both the data core in question card #2 and the statement type in question card #3, the remaining survey question cards for that combination of choices will populate, as well as a skeleton of the preview panel with default assets. Any changes you make using the survey question cards will update the preview panel accordingly.
